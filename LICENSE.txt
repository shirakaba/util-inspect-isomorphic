This project adapts source code from three other projects, attaching their
licences as follows:

- node:
  - https://github.com/nodejs/node
  - LICENSE-node.txt
- node-primordials:
  - https://github.com/isaacs/node-primordials
  - LICENSE-node-primordials.md
- node-inspect-extracted:
  - https://github.com/hildjj/node-inspect-extracted
  - LICENSE-node-inspect-extracted.txt

The Node.js internals adapted in this project mostly consist of the file
lib/internal/util/inspect.js, which does not have the Joyent copyright header.

The maintainers of this package will not assert copyright over this code, but
will assign ownership to the Node.js contributors, with the same license as
specified in the Node.js codebase; the portion adapted here should all be plain
MIT license.

See README.md for a full summary of which source code was adapted from which
projects.
